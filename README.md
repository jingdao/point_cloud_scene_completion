## Data preparation

Ground truth and input files:
[input/ground truth files.zip]()

After unzipping the file there will be an input folder containing all the input files, and a ground truth folder containing all the ground truth files. These files are point clouds stored as PLY files. 

## Baselines
### Hole-filling
To execute the hole filling algorithm:
```
python fill_holes.py input_file.ply
```

### Poisson Reconstruction
To use Poisson Reconstruction download [CloudCompare](https://github.com/cloudcompare/cloudcompare).

Using CloudCompare open the input file and compute its normals.
Use the "poisson recon" plugin to obtain a mesh representation of the input file after poisson reconstruction.
Adjust the SF display parameters range in the properties of the mesh.
Filter the mesh to split the mesh into two, based on the range chosen.
Convert the mesh back into a point cloud by using the sample points tool.

### Plane-fitting
To execute the plane fitting algorithm:
```
python fit_plane_LSE.py input_file.ply
```

### Partial Convolutions

### PCN/FoldingNet/TopNet

Refer to [this](https://github.com/jingdao/completion3d) fork of the Completion3D baselines for
instructions on training and testing PCN/FoldingNet/TopNet with our dataset.

## Generative Adversarial Inpainting

Our proposed method for Generative Adversarial Inpainting is built on top of the Pix2Pix network.
Follow the steps below:

1. Create the "train" and "test" subfolders in the "pix2pix" folder by downloading the following image files from Dropbox:
[train](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iv3kgdvihxpz521/train.zip?dl=0) [test](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v07vi2kyu5j1yj9/test.zip?dl=0)
2. Run the training script `pix2pix/train.sh`. Once done, it should save 11 models in total to the "model" folder
3. Run the script `point-cloud-orthographic-projection/prepare_pix2pix_data.sh`. The script will call the Python file `point_cloud_ortho_projector.py` to generate a RGB image and a depth image for each input point cloud file.
Note that the Python file uses Python 2 and the dependencies need to be installed.
4. Run the testing script `pix2pix/test.sh`. This step will apply the trained Pix2Pix models on input RGB images and output filled RGB images.
5. Run the script `point-cloud-orthographic-projection/get_pix2pix_results.sh`. The script will run the Python file `point_cloud_ortho_projector.py` again to generate PLY point clouds from the filled RGB images.

## Evaluation
You can evaluate your results by running:
```
python getAccuracy.py ground_truth.ply input.ply 
```
This will display the evaluation metrics.
